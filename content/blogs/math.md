Gameplay:

  - Give impulse to the spaceship in one direction by touching the screen.
  - Time slows down when you touch allow you to aim more precisely.
  - The goal for each level is to catch all yellow and white full rounds.
  - You have a limited number of impulse and you need to refill it.
  - When you take a yellow round, you refill one impulse.
  - When you take a blue round, you refill all of the impulse and you can see the map entirely.
  - You lose one impulse when you pass through red planet.
