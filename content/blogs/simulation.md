This animation show how a column can collapse on itself in building. It is called buckling. 

  - Red circles show the value of shear in the column's cell.
  - Black line show maximal compression.
  - Blue line show maximal traction.

It come from my end of study project: devellopement of a tool for structure analysis with Grasshopper.

Here an example of mechanic reaction of a structure with wind loads.

  - Red line show compression.
  - Green line show traction.

Grasshopper software is similar to The Unreal Engine's Blueprint  node-based programation.
